## Admin accounts

The first account created on install is the admin account, which can can be modified and additional administrators can be added.

## Granting Dashboard access

Users with role "Administrator" can grant admin access to other users.

ðŸ’¡ Grant admin access only to system administrators. If you need to grant moderation permissions use the manager role.

To grant administrator Dashboard access to another user:

* Go to the **user profile**
* Click **Edit**
* Select **Administrator** under user role
* Save changes
